# static-site-template

A simple responsive HTML / CSS / minimal JS (jQuery) template for project pages. Uses css from [pure.io](https://purecss.io/start/), parts of [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) with some custom styles, [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

## Nav and Footers

Nav and footers should be updated via the nav.html and footer.html, as they are loaded via jQuery. **NOTE:** Because portions of HTML are loaded, you would need a local webserver for local dev, such as pythons http.server or nodeJS [http-server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server)
